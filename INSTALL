			Installation Procedure

To install Python Audio Tools, you simply need to run:

make install

as root from this source directory. This will use the Python interpreter
to install the audiotools Python module and the executable scripts.
It will then install the man pages from the doc/ subdirectory.

To verify your Python Audio Tools installation, run:

audiotools-config

as a normal user. This will load the audiotools Python module,
if possible, and deliver a listing of available audio formats and
current system settings.


		     Fixing Installation Problems

* The audiotools.cdio module doesn't build correctly

  Check that you have the CDIO library installed, commonly known as libcdio
  If libcdio is installed the module still doesn't build, ensure that
  you've also installed any accompanying libcdio-devel package.


* audiotools-config lists formats as unavailable

  Certain audio formats require external programs. For instance,
  to use FLAC files, Python Audio Tools requires the flac and metaflac
  programs. If these cannot be found in the regular executable search path
  or from the config file, you will not be able to use that format.
  Check your system's package manager for programs which may be available
  but not yet installed.


* My Python interpreter isn't found, or I wish to use a different one

  The first line of Makefile is which Python interpreter is being used for
  installation of both the Python Audio Tools and Construct module.
  For instance, to use a Python interpreter located at
  /opt/python/bin/python, you should change that line to read:

  export PYTHON = /opt/python/bin/python

  Running make will then invoke the new interpreter for installation of
  the audiotools module and scripts.

subdirectory named "audiotools_letter.pdf" and "audiotools_a4.pdf".
